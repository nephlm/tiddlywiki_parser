        "text": "Yes, the land to high heaven at very least will incorporate elements of a torii.  The character doesn't have the kind of resources to deal in gold or gems.  I can introduce an economy breaking power like transmutation or object purification and give it to an ally, but I'd rather not open that can of worms if I don't need to.  At the moment I\"m thinking of free standing torii frame with double doors inside the torii.  Painted with the scene form the a fictional collectible card game with a mana card which is the Plain of High Heaven.  Attached to one door is the proper name of it written in Japanese in the other is the actual card.  The girl plays the collectible card game, or can and nothing about her character precludes it and there has been some precedent for paper or written magic by the MC.\n\nIt had been a while since I read the story of Izanagi and Izanami so I had forgotten the specific element of the boulder.  Probably should have re-read that before posting, but you inspired me to do so which is probably for the better.  It seems like the door should be the boulder itself.  It should be in a stone face with the pillars and rope framing it.  It's card from the game allows returning dead monsters to the game.  The card and the name are affixed to the pillars.\n\nFor sky the best I have so far a skyscape mural with the door in the center of it, but the mural is much larger than just the door.  Sadly the Plane of Elemental Air is a D&D not a proper mythical one.  I don't know that such a place exists in myth.  Probably does I just need to find it.  The bigger issue is the mural is painted on what is essentially earth which feel symbolically wrong.  I thought about using a glass wall and creating the illusion of infinite air behind it, but that then feels like the door goes to the space behind  the door rather than to another world.\n\nI like the meteoric metal for the the outer world.  I'd like to make some sort of non-euclidian thing with no right angles or straight lines.  Perhaps it looks different depending on what angle you look at it from, but I'm not sure that passes the 10 year old test. I'm thinking their might some remnants of previous incursions, bone fragments or something that could be used to forge the connection to the outer world.",

Brown hair that he never manages to get the curl out of, looking slightly disheveled at the best of times. Neatly trimmed mustache and goatee. He wears thick sweaters (in winter) and t-shirts (in summer) and faded jeans.\n\nDescription of past: \nWhen Alex was 20 he fell in love with the girl of his dreams. When he was 21 he found her in bed with his best friend. \n\nAfter a year of licking his wounds and learning to trust again, Alex fell in love with a psychology major with the most beautiful smile. She taught him to not be afraid of sharing his feelings and that seeing a shrink is a good way to resolve some of your issues. Six months later Alex arrived at his psychologist's office early and found his girlfriend undressed and under the Doctor. \n\nDumping the girl, and finding a new psychologist, Alex decided that if all women were just tramps and cheaters he could still spend time with them, but he wouldn't fall in love with them again. Since that time Alex has gone through innumerable girls and relationships that last no longer than a few months before he dumps them. Some girls only last long enough to be a one night stand. \n\nPersonality: He can be very caring, but because he has been burned so many times, he is cautious around new people. \n\nLoves: dogs, Indian food, drive-in movies, and clear summer nights\n\nHates: seafood, fixing broken pipes, & cheating girlfriends\n\nBiggest flaw: He is distrustful of women, and has a difficult time connecting with people ever since his best friend betrayed him.\n\nOne thing he wants more than anything in the world: He thinks it is to live the high life as a rich bachelor, but what he really wants is to find a girl he can trust.",

His younger sister (now 22) still lives in Milan. Shortly before he left for college both of his parents were killed in a car accident. Marcelo moved to Venice on a scholarship to the Ca' Foscari University and never moved back home, falling in love with his new town, and more importantly falling in love with a dark haired beauty named Bianca. He moved into a small, rundown apartment which buts up against one of the many canals. Unfortunately only two weeks after moving in, Bianca broke up with him saying, \"It's not you.

He also hates traveling in cars (ever since his parents accident) and is glad that Venice has so few roads for cars. \n\nPersonality: Sometimes aloof, always watching the people and scenery around him - trying to remember things for later to capture in a picture, is usually very easy going unless very stressed or rattled.

He was no draftsman, so the faces staring out from his hide were variously bloated, palsied, cross-eyed or otherwise deformed. Lack of artistic merit was exacerbated by the fact that the Tattooed Man didn't employ the tools of the professional tattoo artist; instead, he used broken glass, razor blades and ink bought from a stationery shop.

Her hair is almost in her eyes (which are green) and she can't afford nice clothing. \n\nHer mother died during her birth and her father tok out the blame on her, abusing her in various ways until she unleashed her fire powers unwittingly at six years old and set his room on fire after one particularly bad fight. After his body was recovered and identified (sort of) she was taken away to an orphanage, but while there she accidentally set it on fire as well and ran away, terrified, to the swamp by her city. There she was found by the traveling (sp?) bang of alchemists, gypsies, and necromancers that were passing through by town. \n\nUm... that's her backstory as I wrote it, if you want to change it that's totally fine\n\nHer other traits are: She uses a bo staff with fire on each end. She bites her nails and constantly tries to smooth her hair. She is very comfortable around magic, but if encountering normal everyday fire that she can't control she is terrified and has a panic attack.\n\nUm... any more questions and you can ask on the thread or something.

        "text": "The first part of the name, which identifies the genus, must be a word which can be treated as a Latin singular noun in the nominative case. \n\n* The second part of the name, which identifies the species within the genus, is also treated grammatically as a Latin word. It can have one of a number of forms.\n\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in gender. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The house sparrow has the binomial name Passer domesticus. Here domesticus (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The sacred bamboo is Nandina domestica[30] rather than Nandina domesticus, since Nandina is feminine whereas Passer is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant Lansium domesticum, since Lansium is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are -us, -a, -um (as in the previous example of domesticus); -is, -is, -e (e.g. tristis, meaning \"sad\"); and -or, -or, -us (e.g. minor, meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see Latin declension: Adjectives.\n\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is Panthera leo. Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, Panthera is feminine and leo is masculine.\n\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii, the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii, or the Olive-backed Pipit Anthus hodgsoni. The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that Magnolia hodgsonii means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond, in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae, meaning \"of the Chalumna River\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli, where coli means \"of the colon\". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum, where vesparum means \"of the wasps\", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\nElementum\n\n* ventus - wind crafter\n\nCorpus\n\n* immortalis - immortal\n* durus - tough\n* potens - strong\n* teleportum - teleport\n\nAnima\n\n* auditor - can hear prayers\n* machina - technopath\n\nCerebellum\n\n* scitus - big brain\n\nMotus\n\n* auditor - emotion reader",

        "text": "If you haven't read American Gods, maybe give that a go after you've written your novel (or before, if you don't mind the influence).\n\nDrawing a little on that, maybe not all the gods get along so well in the modern era.  Like maybe Hestia's just this lonely old shut-in who keeps trying to get the Family together for a reunion.  Or maybe Dionysus has good decades and bad ones, going on five-year binges only to crash later to wonder what he's doing with his life.  Especially if he didn't have an endless supply of money, and occasionally had to go beg off some of his wealthier friends. \n\nThe muses never had a big role as individual characters doing things--they tended to be more ideas.  I could totally see the Furies forming a motor cycle gang, though. \n\nPoseidon--Probably makes loads of money off of maritime trade.  I imagine he owns a yacht or two.\n\nZeus--A business man, CEO and VIP, possibly owns an airline or two (his competitors seem to have a lot of trouble with the weather).\n\nAthena--Always a daddy's girl, she's the person actually in charge of Zeus's enterprises while he's off playing.  Using her skills as a strategist, she rakes in the money and does especially well during times of war (although she has also stepped in with crucial advice that ends the conflicts, when necessary).\n\nHera--Although at this point she's entirely fed up with Zeus, she'd never leave him.  I wouldn't be surprised if she owned several successful magazine series for women and had authored a series of successful self-help books advising on housekeeping and marriage. \n\nHephaestus--Realized about a century ago that he could totally divorce Aphrodite and did so before she could divorce him.  Widely considered a genius, he's become famous for his line of prostheses, robots and fine jewelry.  It would be horribly ironic if he's dating Freya.\n\nFreya--Probably a model, she owns a cozy apartment somewhere downtown.  She embraced second-wave feminism and sex-positivity with open arms, and continues to use sex to get what she wants.  She's also a cat-lover.\n\nOdin--Definitely a wisdom=power kind of guy.  I could see him entertaining himself at Oxford as a professor, playing his colleagues off of each other and enjoying the vicious politics of academia.  He'd have a lot of fun making his students look like fools too.  I doubt he'd get along with Zeus, who's approach is more power=power, let's go smash that thing.  He would probably really enjoy Athena.\n\nThor--I don't think Thor would adapt well to modernity.  In myth, he's a hero, and frequently the last hope for Asgard.  I could imagine him getting attached to some country--maybe England, maybe not--and fighting a modern war as a soldier.  He went in expecting glory, to fight their champion or maybe a couple of champions, show the enemy's what's what and go home victorious.  Instead, he found out that war had changed dramatically since even a century ago.  Now he spends most of his time traveling, roughing it in the wild, or drinking.\n\nAres--probably selling himself as a mercenary somewhere.  He collects fire arms.\n\nArtemis--Lives a private, rural life where nobody bothers her about hunting.  Probably works as a midwife in Northern Scotland or Ireland and has an especially good rapport with the local girls.  Sexual predators in that village have a tendency to suddenly go missing.  I don't imagine she'd have much interest in the games.\n\nApollo--With a day-job as a successful doctor specializing in contagious disease (maybe works for the British version of the CDC), he spends his weekends playing in obscure venues throughout England.  A total music-snob, he insists on using a lute and is often criticized/praised for his bizarre style.  He has a following of hipsters and music theory majors, but refuses to record anything on the basis that it really ruins the music.\n\nPan--A bizarre, rarely-seen country-punk singer whose irreverent lyrics and innovative style have made him much more popular than Apollo, despite his tendency to disappear for years at a time.  It helps that he actually makes recordings (when he remembers to).  He hangs out with Dionysus sometimes.\n\n\n\n===========\n\n\nGreco/Roman\n\nZeus/Jupiter: He's in an expensive suit (Armani). I never figured out if it was because he was a mob boss of some sort or a CEO of some corporation, but either one would work for him. He also had a couple of scantily clad women hanging off of his arm.\n\nHera/Juno: Can you say \"Desperate Housewives?\" Very wealthy, very bored, extremely jealous (for good reason) and bored.\n\nMinerva/Athena: For some reason I pictured her as a gender-swap Indiana Jones. She'd also work as a high-ranking military official.\n\nPoseidon/Neptune: Surfs up dude! Board shorts and a surf board, he does love the water and the waves. It would also work if he was an oceanographer depending on what age you wanted him to be.\n\nDionysus/Bacchus: The ultimate frat boy, well, until he grows up a bit. After that he may decide to open up his own vineyard or become a food and wine critic, or at the least, a gourmand of some sort who hosts the most outrageously themed parties. See also: John Belushi's character in \"Animal House\" grows up and becomes The Great Gatsby.\n\nHindi\n\nKali (multi-armed Hindi goddess): Poker dealer, complete with the green visor.\n\nEgyptian\n\nBast/Bastet: The automatic thought with her is \"crazy cat lady\" but I picture her more as someone who runs a no-kill shelter for cats or is professionally involved in cat rescue in some form. Heck, she could even work for a show like \"Big Cat Diaries\"\n\n\n=================\n\n",

        "text": "Coffee Seeker: Intuitively knows what to do to get the fastest cup of coffee.  Not the best, but the fastest.  A lot of the time it's make it himself taking horrible short cuts.\n\nPoly-Lingual: when he speaks everyone can understand him.\n\nThe ability to always predict the weather perfectly (Or, for an added bonus, knowing at exactly what minute the sunrise, sunset, high-tide, and low-tide will be.)\n\nA low-key superpower: A character has two separate, functional minds (maybe even physical brains) that work together, and is fully ambidextrous, allowing them to write a separate book with each hand simultaneously,  draw two parts of a picture at once, or watch TV with one eye and read with the other, and has used it to become very productive and wealthy.\n\nSerenity : Can make people feel calm and tranquil. S/he most likely earns stupid amounts of money at a five-star spa.\n\nturning invisible but only when you close your eyes \n\ncan make cardboard boxes of any (reasonable) size when ever you want!! pretty nifty huh?\n\nThe ability to see an object's history by touch, the longer you hold it the further back you go, the faster you move, the faster it 'rewinds' \n\nWhen you look at a photo you can see it free of alterations, you know exactly where it was taken and can see the surrounding area \n\nable to trigger normal bodily functions like sneezes (useful for the first one) or can make you hiccup or yawn or laugh uncontrollably \n\nThe ability to see through or around objects.\n\nTiny weather! Like you can just create little tiny thunderstorms or tornadoes or clouds on the palms of your hands. Not much use for it but I think it's neat. Make it rain on the palm of your hand!!\n\nAbility to produce metal out of hands. Like, can you imagine, this person is stalking toward you, and they flick their wrist and a whole sword blade comes shooting out? A sword blade they are now holding and still stalking toward you with? Can you imagine? Badass. (must be limited to relatively cheap, low density metal or it's truly powerful)\n\nHidden Face: the ability to remove face recognition from someone (a vital ability).  Maybe also not recognizable even in person while under the power.  Essentially every person or machine looking at the person has selective face blindness. \n\nAquatic Invisibility: Completely invisible when submerged.\n\nFire Shnozzle:\nThe 'farmer's hanky of death' allows this individual to plug one nostril and blow a stream of fire out the other. Needless to say, facial hair hasn't been an option for this guy. At least not on that side.\n\nSharkbite:\nHer teeth are supernaturally sharp and incredibly dense. Plus she's got jaw muscles like an alligator. She can literally chew through a metal bar.\n\nYOLO:\nBorn without fear, this guy has tried every extreme sport under the sun and is always on the lookout for more. His cool under pressure allows him to perform feats of daring that would terrify anyone else. As a result he's become good at doing things most people would consider impossible. He might also have some kind of luck-factor because he's still alive.\n\nIceburg:\nShe can control the shape of ice. Seems pretty worthless as a power until you get into a fight with her next to a frozen lake or a glacier.\n\nFireman:\nThe angrier he gets the hotter he becomes until he's red hot. Fortunately, he takes no damage from heat. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his clothing. Doctors have warned him about getting cancer from wearing asbestos drawers, but he's got no other option as long as he keeps rage-inducing his job. (His wife is his boss).\n\nFlutterby:\nShe can psionically generate and direct swarms of explosive blacklight butterflies. So pretty!\n\nHeyStupid:\nHas the telepathic ability to make people stupid. This typically results in his victims making the wrong decisions. Yes, you can make it over the train tracks in time. Light a match and check the gas tank to see if you're out of fuel. Don't worry, the tiger is asleep. I wonder what this button does? He usually follows up the stupidification with a stupid suggestion. \n\nBlackout:\nHer physical strength and durability increases the more alcohol she drinks. She might save the world, but she won't remember it.\n\n* Make a room turn black\n* Create stacks of pancakes\n* By the pricking of my thumbs, know when wicked this way comes\n* stretch one arm but for every meter, loses ability to lift 10 kilos.\n* the Zan power: Form of Ice Unicycle ; Shape of Waterbucket\n* Talk to fish\n\nI don't have episodes of Spice and Wolf handy for inspiration, but I can think of a few money-based powers.\n\nAssessor - Sees the net worth of a person and/or the value of objects at a glance.\n\nScrounger - Detects money. Could be a novel tracking device, but more likely to enable a professional couch-surfer.\n\nDow Jones Prophet - The ability to know the stock index of all companies in the near future. Great excuse to include the line \"My NASDAQ senses are tingling!\"\n\nThe Ebay Merchant - Converts any object into credit. If enough is left in this person's account, they can buy it back. If I had this power, I would keep a Bengal tiger in my account at all times, just in case.\n\nIndicator - A person who gains physical strength in proportion to the strength of the Turkish lira. Makes a great villain, as in order to strip them of their powers, the heroes would need to crash the Turkish economy.\n\nConversion - The ability to convert physical money from one currency to another. Great for pranks, handy for investment in coins, niche applications if they know chemistry and can do something with the metal. If they get a suitcase full of money, they could convert it to one of the giant stone coins of Yap.\n\nAnimate Image (Tarot)\n\nEmpath (project)\n\nObsession (with an object)\n",

The powers are the collections of unfocused thought, the result of humanity thinking generally about such concepts as Air, Wind, Shinto etc. without giving it a particular personification.  Some of the powers are effectively as old as the earth itself.  Wind came into existence The moment a pterosaur took to the sky and began to care about the wind.  Air actually didn't come into existence later and by comparison to those ancient courts, Shinto is a johnny come lately.\n\nThe Power and the Court are one thing, the Power has no ability to leave the court and go wandering.  Powers tend to be only vaguely anthropomorphized.  They are too vast and broad for that.  Some may not even have humanoid forms, much less humans.  Quite apart from the characteristics ascribed to them by humanity, many Powers are responsible for the running of physics and similar domains.\n\nEntry to and exit from a to a court must be at a location which is deemed of significance to the court.  Sometimes these places are unexpected.  Admittance to a court is one of the basic requirements of immortality.  Admittance is dependent of having worshipers or at least someone who says the words and performs the rituals.  An act of attention and respect cast upon the ether.  By definition all courts pre-date their members.",

There were and are many who vie for Ebisu's fortunes, but few with the connections and skills of Riku bartered their service in exchange for it. \n\nRiku was running several small unlicensed casinos and loosing money on all of them.  Unless something changed he'd be called before his oyabun to make amends.\n\nHe was loosing money because he considered  it his duty to protect his men.  As a oyabun, not a single one of his men spent a day in jail.  Some may have wished for it but he would never allow it.  \n\nLarge amounts of what should have been profits were dedicated forging the relationships with police and judges to make sure that never happened. \n\nDuring this time he facilitated some human trafficking.  \n\n---\n\nSoon after the emergence of the gods [[Hoderi]], the fisherman, was working the boats out of Niigata.  It was a simple life and he liked the fishing, but loved the drunken brawls that happens when fishermen got home more. \n\nHe did this for several years until he was lying on the shore late at night, drunk as drunk can be, when his brother [[Hoori]] walked out of the sea.  With each step he freed a fishing hook stuck in his clothing and tossed it aside.  \n\nThis infuriated Hoderi and the two came to blows.  Eventually the police were called and Hoderi didn't fight them and soon found himself in a jail far from his brother. \n\n[[Amaterasu]] considered this an unacceptable shame and she turned to those around her for how to fix this disgrace.  Few had much contact or influence on the mortal world, but eventually word reached [[Ebisu]] and while he promised no influence he suggested he might have a worshiper committed enough to help with the right incentives.  \n\nAmaterasu ordered him to make it so with the full support and power of the pantheon behind him.  Ebisu went to to earth and struck a deal with Riku.  It took little effort for Riku to spring Hoderi and he has been the official fixer of the court since.   \n\n---\n\n* What does he know?\n\nOriginal arrangement was with Ebisu, but over the years his instructions were to honor the request of any of the pantheon.  \n\nAt some point there was a conflict and his chain of command was clarified.  The final entry on that list is \"The highest status kami\"    How to determine status for that last entry is less clear.  \n\nOver the years he's been tasked with delivering a message to that person when they suddenly became the senior living kami.  It's usually been someone in his list. \n\nBut in delivering this message for 45 years he's picked things up from the reactions and off hand comments.  \n\nHe's come to believe that the gods expect a dark war.  It may be now in may be a thousand years, but it will happen.  And the gods serve a role responding to that invasion.  The specific nature of it, he does not know, but failing in the moment of crisis would endanger the role he's tried to build for his clan. ",

It felt like the Symphony.  The wind chime melody came from the building and four paper lanterns lit the corners of it.  While wondering if the building had a comfortable bench to lay down on, I found myself wandering toward it.  Niko watched but let me get fifteen or twenty feet away before he followed.  \n\nThe structure turned out to be more roof than anything else.  It overhung on all sides and  gently curved.  A torii, one of those big square arches with two beams on top and supported by two columns, stood in front of the structure.  \n\nI froze for a moment.\n\nTorii signified the entrance to a Shinto shrine.  Unless an architect had stolen random Asian elements, this was such a shrine.  I sought any sign indicating who it venerated, but didn't know what to look for.  I'd never seen one in person before.\n\nShrines were dangerous.  They were exactly the place a person with my father— and all the extended family that came with that —shouldn't go when trying to lay low.  It was the kind of place where one whispered word might have tragic consequences.  \n\nJust a quick look around, then I'd leave.\nBehind the torii lay a low pool open to the sky.  Three steps led from the water and into the building, which resembled a gazebo but square.  A large column stood in the center of the building.  \n\nDelicate woodwork decorated doors on the the front side of the column.  Inside the cabinet, hidden from my view, sat an obelisk made of the same blue stone as the butterfly necklace I wore.  \n\nNot the same type of stone, rather they came from the same vein.  Carved by the same craftsman, I was certain.\n\nMy hands shook.  I shouldn't have known what was inside that cabinet, much less where it came from.  \n\nA low wooden fence boxed in the other three sides of the building and braided rope marked off the confines of the sacred space.  In the rear-right corner with its own roof under the larger one, sat a small cabinet, a miniature version of the building.\n\nA mosaic in the shape of a compass rose decorated with themes of wind and air made up the bottom of the pool.  Yellow letters encircled the compass and said, \"For a fair wind and just enough of it, give reverence to Kaze-no-kami, the wind.\" \n<<<<",

Growing up, his parents were going through a bad divorce--the really bad kind, where things smash and there's blood and cops are called. Whenever they started fighting, he would watch the original Star Wars trilogy over and over again until it stopped. Hiding in that world was the only way he was able to function in the real one, effectively making him one of the biggest Star Wars nerds ever, complete with having the Rebel insignia actually tattooed on his arm. When things got too bad at home, he was finally shipped off to live with other relatives. A natural trouble maker, Cole likes to press buttons and test things until they break. Couple with the fact that he never felt safe in his own home, he grew up to be tough, bitter, and more insecure than he would ever admit--which he over-compensates for. He was passed around from relative to relative when his guardians couldn't deal with him any longer, and each time he was sent away, he grew a little more resentful. Things started changing for him when he started living with a great aunt, who (to put it bluntly) didn't take crap from anyone. She worked to set him straight, and along the way he discovered the cello. Nothing had ever come so easily to him before, or gave him such joy, and he found that he was incredibly gifted when it came to that particular instrument. \n\nAdditional info: Cole is so far in the closet he's in Narnia (again, insecure). In his most recent incarnation, he was living in a van by the river.",

She spent those weed-hazed nights counting stars, multiplying constellations, and dividing the hours by the number of puffs on the shisha before her mother fell asleep.\n\nIt's hard to work in a sensible profession like accountancy when your name is Sparkle, but Yen refuses to change it.

Yen never did find out where.\n\nBut one day, Yen gets a call from a new client, who turns out to be a face from her mother's hippie past. And what he has to say is something so fantastical that it sets Yen off on an adventure that will eclipse any wild journey that she'd even taken with her mother.\n\n— \n\nYen has wound her way into my heart.

Volume pumped through the Symphony, but not much in the way of tempo.  Calvert Cliffs used to be a nuclear power plant and cement husks of buildings still littered the grounds.  Little more than the cement floors, ceilings and roofing remained of the buildings.  Dozens of large empty rooms, but the RV stood in the parking lot, and I lived out of it.  The cement walls reminded me too much of Camp Sanctuary.\n\nCalvert Cliffs wasn't as remote as Camp Sanctuary, but few people lived in the immediate area.  The cliffs overlooked the Chesapeake Bay half an hour south of the city suburbs. A chair and table from the thrift store stood outside the door of the RV and looked out over the cliffs and the bay.  Wind turbines somewhat marred the view, but I didn't mind.  \n\nAfter taking a step back, I surveyed the shrine markers I’d just laid.  A wind chime hung from each of the shrines.  Westerlies’ shrine stood at the side of the road.  I spent a lot of time watching woodworking videos to learn enough to make it.  No one would confuse it for pretty, but it was a shrine.  Shrines to Erion and Artemis’ bow stood next to Westerlies.  They deserved shrines.\n<<<<",
