# tiddlywiki_parser
Parse the tiddler our of a tiddlywiki for backup and git management

A simple tool to extract the tiddlers from a [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) (A personal, non-linear web notebook (aka a wiki in a file)).

Eventually this will also build a tree or in some other way parse the actual tiddlers, but that isn't an immediate need.
